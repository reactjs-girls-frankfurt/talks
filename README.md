# ReactJS Girls Frankfurt - Talks & Requests

In this repository we would like to collect ideas for talks and requests for talks.

## Talk Proposals

If you want to pitch a talk, [create an issue with the proposal label](https://github.com/reactjs-girls-frankfurt/talks/issues/new?labels=proposal). Please give a brief description of your talk and let us know how long it is.

If you want to give a talk but don't know a topic, have a look at the ideas!

Let me also reiterate, that a user group is the perfect opportunity to do a practice run for a conference talk you are going to give. The community is happy to give you feedback.

# Talk Ideas

If you are interested in a topic, you can [create an issue with the idea label](https://github.com/reactjs-girls-frankfurt/talks/issues/new?labels=idea). Please give us a short text what exactly you want to know about the given topic.

If you have a certain person in mind that can give the talk, please @mention them in the issue and we might be able to get them to come to lovely Frankfurt üòÑüëç

Thanks [Ruby Frankfurt Meetup](https://github.com/ruby-frankfurt) for giving me the go to use your talk proposal system!
